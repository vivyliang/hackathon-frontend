# Duets: A Healthy Social Media Alternative

Hi, we are Team8 (team**MATE**!) and we are happy to introduce our project: **Duets**. 

Our team consists of Daniel L as the project manager, Daniel K as marketing manager, Vivian as UI/UX designer/frontend developer, and Matt as full stack developer. As a team, we are all passionate about providing a healthy online environment and that's why we accepted the challenge of addressing problem gambling, video games, and social media addiction through the creation of mental health support networks.
